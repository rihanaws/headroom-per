# Progress

## Phase 0 — COMPLETE (3 of 4 acceptance criteria met)

### Verified results

1. **✅ Headroom `/health` and `/stats` return successfully** with Claude Code routed through it.
   - `/health` → `status=healthy, ready=True, version=0.26.1`
   - `/stats` → returns compression stats, cost breakdown, request counts
   - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787` confirmed in shell
   - LaunchAgent installed: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.headroom.default.plist` (persistent-service, login-only)

2. **⏭️ Greptile token rotation — SKIPPED** (see tracked risk below)

3. **✅ Resource baseline measured and passes 1.5GB gate.**
   - Headroom proxy: 16.7 MB RSS
   - Headroom MCP serve: 5.2 MB RSS
   - Claude Mem worker: 69.6 MB RSS
   - KB MCP server: 0 MB (stdio, launched on demand)
   - **Combined idle: 91.6 MB** — well under 1,536 MB threshold

4. **✅ Claude Mem ingestion job ran successfully.**
   - First run: fetched 574 observations, wrote 574 to KB (0 → 574 observations, 2 → 13 entities)
   - Second run: fetched 574, wrote 0 (deduplication confirmed)
   - Hash log persisted to `ingestion-hashes.json`

### Tracked risk (not silently skipped)
- **Greptile credential exposure**: API token stored in plaintext in `~/.claude/` plugin config area. Exposed since at least the Greptile plugin was first configured. User explicitly deferred rotation and Keychain migration during this session. **Revisit trigger**: before enabling any new MCP server that reads `~/.claude/settings.json`, before sharing config with another machine, or at the start of Phase 1 if time allows.

### Documentation corrections applied
- SKILL.md: "62 projects seeded" → "Phase 0 audit found 2 entities and 0 observations"

## Phase 1 — COMPLETE (2 of 2 acceptance criteria met)

### Verified results
1. **✅ Headroom memory store persists data across a hard process kill (`kill -9`).**
   - Verified that a test memory entry written to `memory.db` survives a hard `kill -9` of the `headroom` process and is successfully read back using `test_persistence.py`.
2. **✅ Deliberate knowledge-base health-check failure triggers fallback and tags capsule `degraded: true`.**
   - Created [retrieve_with_fallback.py](file:///Users/rihan/Downloads/rihan-personal-ai/retrieve_with_fallback.py).
   - Under healthy KB API: successfully returns results with `degraded: false`.
   - Under offline KB (`ConnectionRefusedError`): successfully falls back to Headroom's persistent HNSW memory backend and sets `degraded: true`.
   - Under hung KB / latency (socket timeout): correctly gates failover (rejects fallback), exits with code 1, and prints error message to stderr.

### What's next
- Phase 2: Extend the existing knowledge-base entity-observation model with prompt/response summaries, tool calls, and redaction logic.
